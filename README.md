This is my first proper internal cheat that I didn't follow tutorials to make. It was definitely a difficult project.
After compiling and injecting, NUMPAD1 is for aimbot, NUMPAD2 is for ESP.
I don't plan on adding more features to this cheat, as I feel like it will be more beneficial for me to go back to 32-bit games and learn how to hook functions. I do, however, plan on fixing any bugs and imrpvoing the quality of the code.

KNOWN BUGS:
ESP flickering - I know why, I don't know how to fix...
Aimbot going back to second player in entitylist - I just need to add checking and aimbot priority, but there is no point.
